#The distance between two points (x0,y0) and (x1,y1) is (x0−x1)2+(y0−y1)2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√.
# Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the distance between the points (2,2) and (5,6).
# (Hint: Remember that a square root can be computed by raising a value to the 0.5 power.)

x0=2
y0=2
x1=5
y1=6

distance= ((x0-x1)**2+(y0-y1)**2)**.5
print (distance)
